My web app, “Your Text, Your Style,” is designed to seamlessly transform raw text into a polished, custom-styled presentation. The core of this process lies in a two-stage approach: intelligent content parsing and meticulous style application.
First, the user’s text input, which can be long-form prose or markdown, is sent to a large language model (LLM) of their choice. The user-provided API key ensures this process is secure and private. The LLM is given a specific prompt that instructs it to analyze the text and structure it into a logical flow suitable for a presentation. This includes suggesting a title, creating an outline, and breaking down the content into individual slide summaries. Crucially, the prompt can be customized with user guidance (e.g., “create an investor pitch deck”) to influence the structure and tone, ensuring the generated content aligns with their specific use case. The LLM's output is not a fixed number of slides but a dynamic structure that intelligently maps the input text's length and complexity.
The second stage involves applying the visual style from the user's uploaded PowerPoint template. We use the python-pptx library to parse the .pptx or .potx file. This library allows us to access and extract key design elements: theme colors, font schemes, slide layouts, and embedded images. Once the LLM has generated the slide content, our application iterates through the structured data. For each slide, we select a suitable layout from the template (e.g., a title slide for the presentation title, a content-with-title layout for a main point). We then populate the new presentation with the LLM-generated text, ensuring the text boxes, fonts, and colors match the styles extracted from the template. The app reuses images found within the template's master slides or layouts, mapping them to relevant content where appropriate, without generating any new images. The final output is a brand new .pptx file, ready for download, that beautifully marries the user's content with their chosen visual aesthetic.
